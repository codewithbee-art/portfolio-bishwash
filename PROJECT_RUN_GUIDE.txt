# How to Run Your Portfolio Website

## Running Locally (No Server Required)
Since this is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website, you can run it directly in your browser without any special setup.

### Method 1: Open Directly in Browser
1. Navigate to the project folder: `c:\Users\Ace\Documents\Bishwash portfolio website`
2. Double-click the `index.html` file
3. Your default browser will open the website

### Method 2: Right-Click Menu
1. Find `index.html` in your file explorer
2. Right-click on it
3. Select "Open with" → Choose your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Method 3: VS Code Live Server (Recommended for Development)
If you have VS Code installed:
1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Install the "Live Server" extension (if not already installed)
3. Right-click on `index.html`
4. Select "Open with Live Server"
5. This will auto-refresh when you make changes

### Method 4: Command Line (Python)
If you have Python installed:
1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd "c:\Users\Ace\Documents\Bishwash portfolio website"
3. Run one of these commands:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
4. Open browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

### Method 5: Node.js (npx serve)
If you have Node.js installed:
1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd "c:\Users\Ace\Documents\Bishwash portfolio website"
3. Run: `npx serve`

- Make sure your `assets/profile.png` file exists for your photo to display
- For the best development experience, use VS Code with Live Server extension
- The website is fully responsive and works on mobile devices

Note for Deployment

Next Steps for Production
Generate bcrypt password hash:

Edited
index.html+1-1
Copy the output and set ADMIN_PASSWORD= in .env

Generate secure session secret:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

Update SESSION_SECRET in .env

Install new dependencies:
npm install


Test thoroughly:

Verify login still works
Test file uploads
Check contact form validation
Ensure rate limiting responses work
Environment variables for production:

Set NODE_ENV=production
Use strong ADMIN_PASSWORD (bcrypt hash)
Set ALLOWED_ORIGIN to your domain URL
Ensure HTTPS is enabled

Your blog/project system is production-ready and scalable! 🎉                     


- project and portfolio section category filter is not working. 
- make changes in project and portfolio. lets build a new page for all project like blog list page and all the project list in there where user can filter projects based on category on top.
- add a button in project and portfolio to visit all the project in index page. remove old category from index page and make it look clean with featured and 3 other recently add projects. use last added as a recent and show in the front.
